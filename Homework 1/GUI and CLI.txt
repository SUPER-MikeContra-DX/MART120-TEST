GUI and CLI are just two different ways you can interact with a computer environment. For GUI (Graphical User Interface), as the name implies, you are given options in the form of graphical icons which you can click on to execute certain commands. With CLI (Command Line interface) you execute commands via a terminal which you type commands into. Both options allow you to do essentially the same things just through varying means. While GUIs are the standard and allow the easier user experience, often it is a lot faster and more efficient to use a CLI.
