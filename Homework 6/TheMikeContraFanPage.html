                This place is totally the place man. I got a homeboy workin here that goes crazy on the shakers. Totally mesmorizing, almost makes me forget how much the food sucks.

                Nothin better than throwing on sum steely dan and taking a big bite outta some chumps newly purchased vinyl. Fair warning though, I don't think most of you nerds can handle the heat when it comes to digesting plastic.

                <img src="paul-s-waffle-house.jpg" />
                My MeeMaw drew her last breath right before choking on a mega load of pancakes. Her soul is now eternally trapped in the booth nearest the bathrooms. Great for a bit of chatter with dearly departed. Gotta love them pancakes too!

                So called "Doctors" will thell you not to eat food from The Dump. What a load of malarkey. Plenty of viable options here, plus I live at the dump so the comute couldn't be any better. Eat that mold. Drink that non-discript liquid. Become Ungovernable.

            <h3>Mike Contra's Top 3 Websites</h3>
            Now this one's really gonna get me in trouble. Don't fear tho, for those who want it, Mike Contra is here to deliver!
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">WIKIPEDIA</a></li>
                <img src="wikipedia.jpeg" />
                The library is run by lizard people so whenever i wanna chillax and watch some flix i read the plot on WIKIPEDIA. Air Bud is my favorite movie.
                <li><a href="TheMikeContraFanPage.html">THE MIKE CONTRA FAN PAGE</a></li>
                <img src="Leghorseidle-3.png" />
                probably the most important website of the 21st century. I read on here that Mike Contra's MeeMaw haunts Paul's Pancake Parlor, isn't that neat! Severe lack of Air Bud plot tho so it comes in at a screeching second.
