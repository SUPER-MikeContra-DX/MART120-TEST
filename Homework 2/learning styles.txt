Learning styles seem fairly important when it comes to how you go about studying and learning. While I feel it’s possible for anyone to learn and study in any way but  how you learn best and adjusting accordingly will make things easier to not just learn but retain. I also feel like understanding how you learn can be beneficial for those who teach you, if you can understand it better yourself you can better ask for the support that will benefit you. I also learned some other stuff from the article such as the benefit of spacing out your study sessions. I’ve always been a marathon studier and at times I've definitely struggled with that way of doing it so I am going to try spacing out my studying and see if that leads to me retaining more.
