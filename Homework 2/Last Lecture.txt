The Last Lecture Paper

9/7
The Last Lecture left me feeling inspired and motivated amongst other things. The lecture revolves around approaching and succeeding at your childhood dreams. This topic is relatable to most everyone I believe as we all were children at one point so childhood dreams are extremely common. It’s sorta a bold choice to continue to chase these dreams into adulthood, by nature of being from our childhood they often air on the side of grandiose and unrealistic. I really enjoyed how Pausch never gave up on his dreams though, and those which were never actually in grasp, such as playing in the NFL, he was able to spin to fit his reality. Probably my favorite quote of the lecture has got to be the one about getting experience when you don't get what you want. I feel like it’s easy for me to feel super defeated about projects when they don’t come together perfectly so that shift in perspective really hit me hard and I feel like it gave me a different way of looking at things. I was doing some more research about pauch and his talk after the video and apparently there’s also a book written about the lecture and his life around that time. What hit me was someone said in the comments of the video that when his wife goes to hug him after they sing happy birthday she whispers “please don't die.” It’s obvious from the audience reaction and just the overwhelming feeling of love in the room that this pausch guy really left an impact on a lot of people and is probably sorely missed.
